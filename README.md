## Analysis Focus
This lab focuses on analyzing the Superstore dataset (2019-2022) to understand the impact of discounts on sales and profitability across different regions, using the DIVE framework (Discover, Investigate, Validate, Extend).

Key findings include the negative correlation between discount rates and profitability, particularly in the Central region and for Furniture products, with strategic recommendations for optimizing discount strategies, enhancing customer lifetime value, and implementing margin-focused product strategies.
